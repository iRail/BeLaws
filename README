Incentive
----------

This project is intended to provide an easy way to search the Belgian lawbook. As every citizen is considered to know the lawbook we figured there should be an easy way to get this information as easy as possible. We're doing this with the iRail project since the iRail NPO needs to look up laws now and then. Because we're not satisfied with the current one, we decided to develop our own.
